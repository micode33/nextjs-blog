<h1>Next JS Blog</h1>

We've been learning react.js in our AWS Cloud Computing course with the Unitec Institute of Technology. I decided to experiment with next.js to expand my knowledge and understanding of react.js.

I've followed the learning guide located at [https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs) to get this little blog site working.
